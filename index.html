    <h1><Summary>Summary</Summary></h1>
    <hr>
    <p>I have, as a result of work experience, taught myself Web Development
        to a good working standard and have had experience through school, <br> 
        with JavaScript, Java, Python, HTML and CSS.And along with 
        learning IT Service Management which is interesting to use, as it can 
        show immediate outcomes. <br> I have tried to develop different solutions
        through a variety of languages as this has allowed me to see
        different outcomes  <br> and different methods that can be used
        to develop answers  and to try and solve the problem as 
        efficiently as possible so it meets the needs of the solution.
